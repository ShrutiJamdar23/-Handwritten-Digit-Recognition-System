# -Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-System
This project builds a deep learning system to recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) from images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). It can handle variations in writing style and is extendable to read digit sequences (e.g., zip codes, license plates). Once trained, it takes an image as input and outputs the predicted digit(s).
